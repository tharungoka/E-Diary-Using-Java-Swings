# E-Diary-Using-Java-Swings
Hello, "E-Diary Using Java Swings" is a small project that includes the features of creating notes, updating notes, managing notes and a chatbot (specifically meant for elementary os). It is a basic java project done by me and my team mates in my college(MVSR Engineering College,Hyderabad) in 2018.


This project is built on the linux platform (Specifically Elementary OS) hence this project may not be as good in other platforms 

If you want this project in your machine you need to change some settings in our project

Changes have to be made according to the operating system that you are using

For notes we have made a command regarding notepad instead you can use your own editor

For ChatBot commands we have used commands that are specifically related to elementary os you can change them ccording to your operating system.
